📘 Structural Analysis of a Hexagonal Prism Using ANSYS Mechanical


This repository contains the documentation and results of a structural analysis project conducted on a regular hexagonal prism using ANSYS Mechanical (2024 R1). The work includes both linear static structural analysis and transient structural analysis, supported by mesh convergence studies, result visualizations, and a professional presentation.

📂 Contents of the Repository
1. Project Report (PDF)
2. 2. Presentation (in PDF form)

A detailed engineering report and presentation containing:

Geometry and modelling approach

Material properties (linear elastic model)

Static structural loading and boundary conditions

Transient loading and time-dependent forces

Mesh refinement and convergence study

Stress, deformation, and directional response plots

Interpretation of minimum, maximum, and average results

Discussion and conclusion




📌 Project Summary

The static analysis examines the deformation and stress response of the prism under a 2013 N transverse remote force, applied at one-third of its length from the fixed end. 

The transient analysis investigates the time-varying structural response under multiple applied forces on different faces, evaluating minimum, maximum, and average stresses and deformations across the simulation time.

A mesh convergence study was conducted to ensure numerical accuracy for both.
